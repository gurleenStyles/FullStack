            <p>
                I am a passionate developer with experience in building web applications.
                My journey in technology started with a fascination for coding and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked on various projects that have helped me grow my skills in
                front-end and back-end development. I enjoy learning new technologies and
                applying them to create efficient and user-friendly applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I love contributing to open-source projects and sharing
                knowledge with others in the developer community.
